Welcome to the second session — 'Control Structures and Functions'. 

 

Control structures are the essence of programming since they help computers do what they do best — automate repetitive tasks intelligently. The most common control structures are if-else statements, for and while loops, and (specific to Python) list and dictionary comprehensions. This session will cover all of these.

 

Another crucial thing you will learn in Session 2 is to write your own functions. Almost every powerful program — whether a web app or a machine learning algorithm — is basically a set of functions written to perform specific tasks.

Guidelines for in-module questions
The in-video and in-content questions in this session are not graded. All the other activities are non-graded as well and do not carry any weight in the assessments.
