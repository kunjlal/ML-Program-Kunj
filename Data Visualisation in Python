Introduction to Matplotlib

Data visualisation is an important skill to possess for anyone trying to extract and communicate insights from data. Great business narratives and presentations often stem from brilliant visualisations that convey the key ideas in a concise and aesthetic manner. In the field of machine learning, visualisation plays a key role throughout the entire process of analysis - to obtain relationships, observe trends and portray the final results as well. Therefore, it is imperative that you learn and master this tool which will aid you throughout this program.

Facts and Dimensions

Graphics and visuals, when used intelligently and innovatively, can convey a lot more than what raw data alone can. Matplotlib serves the purpose of providing multiple functions to build graphs from the data stored in your lists, arrays, etc. So, let’s start with the first lecture on Matplotlib.

 

Before we start discussing different types of plots, you need to learn about the elements that help us create charts and plots effectively. There are two types of data, which are as follows:

Facts

Dimensions

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

To recap, Matplotlib allows you to use a simple and intuitive workflow to create plots. The important Matplotlib commands used in the video above are as follows:

plt.bar(x_component, y_component): Used to draw a bar graph
plt.show(): Explicit command required to display the plot object
A bar graph is helpful when you need to visualise a numeric feature (fact) across multiple categories. In the example covered in the video, you plotted the sales amount (numeric feature) under three different product categories


Scatter plot, as the name suggests, displays how the variables are spread across the range considered. It can be used to identify a relationship or pattern between two quantitative variables and the presence of outliers within them.

plt.scatter(x_axis, y_axis)
